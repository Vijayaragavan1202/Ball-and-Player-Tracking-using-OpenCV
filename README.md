# Ball-and-Player-Tracking-using-OpenCV
This project implements an automated system to track players and the ball in sports videos using a YOLOv11 deep learning model. The system assigns unique IDs to each player as long as they are visible, draws bounding boxes and labels in real time, and exports each playerâ€™s position to a CSV file for further analysis.
